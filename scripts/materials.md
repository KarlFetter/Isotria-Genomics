## Methods

### Genomic DNA Isolation

A small portion of leaf (approximately 1cm in length) was cut from frozen plant material (-80 degree storage) for genomic DNA isolation using the Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA).  Genomic DNA isolation followed manufacturer protocol with the exception of the following beginning steps:  Cut plant leaf tissue was manually disrupted with a small disposable pestle in a 1.5mL LoBind Eppendorf tube while in pre-warmed lysis buffer /proteinase K solution for 30 seconds.  After a 3 hour incubation at 56 degrees, the homogenized sample was centrifuged for 3 minutes at 12,000 rcf to pellet the plant material.  Clean supernatant was transferred to a new tube and re-centrifuged for an additional 1 minute at 12,000 rcf to remove any remaining plant material.  Clean supernatant was again moved to a new tube and the remaining steps of the protocol followed the manufacturer instructions, beginning with RNase A addition.  

### Genomic DNA QC

Purified genomic DNA was quantified using the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay for Qubit 3.0 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).  To assess fragmentation, gDNA was analyzed on the Agilent TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using the Genomic DNA assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).  

### Illumina DNA library preparation 

Genomic DNA samples were normalized to 2ng/uL in preparation for whole genome shotgun library preparation using the Illumina DNA Nano library Preparation kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).  Libraries were validated for length (350bp insert target length) and adapter dimer removal using the Agilent TapeStation 4200 D1000 High Sensitivity assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) then quantified and normalized using the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay for Qubit 3.0 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).  

Sample libraries were prepared for Illumina sequencing by denaturing and diluting the libraries per manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).  One prepared library was diluted to the target concentration of 0.4nM and run on a lane of the S4 Illumina NovaSeq 6000 version 1.5 chemistry flow cell with paired end 150bp reads.
